🔍 THE PROBLEM
Legacy VPNs Don’t Know Who Is Connected

Traditional VPNs authenticate devices or shared credentials — not people.

This leads to:

No clear accountability

Slow or impossible access revocation

Painful audits

Lingering access after offboarding

Security teams are left asking:

“Who is actually on our network right now?”

🔐 THE ZYLOCK SOLUTION
Identity-Aware Access, Without SaaS Dependency

Zylock replaces legacy VPNs with identity-bound network access.

Every connection is:

Authenticated via SSO (OIDC)

Tied to a specific user and device

Logged immutably

Revocable instantly

All deployed as a single self-hosted binary.

⚙️ HOW IT WORKS (Simple, Clear)

User logs in with SSO (Google today, more coming)

Admin approves access (JIT provisioning)

Device receives a certificate (mTLS)

WireGuard tunnel is established

All activity is logged and attributable

No shared credentials.
No anonymous tunnels.

✅ WHAT YOU GET
Identity & Control

SSO / OIDC authentication

Admin approval workflow

Immediate session revocation

Device-bound certificates (mTLS)

Visibility & Compliance

Immutable audit logs

User, device, IP, and session tracking

SOC2 / ISO-friendly evidence

Operational Simplicity

Single binary deployment

Embedded UI (no external dependencies)

Works in air-gapped environments

WireGuard performance

🚫 WHAT ZYLOCK DOES NOT DO (HONESTY BUILDS TRUST)

Zylock does not:

Replace application authentication

Enforce file-level permissions

Act as an application proxy

Zylock controls who gets on the network.
Your systems control what they can do.

🎯 WHO IT’S FOR

Security-conscious SMBs (10–300 users)

Regulated environments

On-prem / hybrid infrastructure

Teams that want control, not SaaS lock-in

Not designed for:

Zero-infrastructure startups

App-level ZTNA use cases (yet)

💰 LICENSING (KEEP THIS LIGHT)
Simple Annual Licensing

Free up to 10 users

Paid plans starting around $180/user/year

Enterprise licensing available

Self-hosted. No per-connection fees. No data leaving your network.
